## Overview
AgentQnA is a hierarchical multi-agent system designed for complex question-answering applications. The system coordinates specialized agents to break down complex queries and synthesize comprehensive responses.

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. Query Analysis
- **Input Processing**: Receives user query and analyzes complexity
- **Intent Recognition**: Identifies the type of question and required expertise
- **Task Planning**: Determines which agents need to be involved

### 2. Agent Coordination
- **Task Distribution**: Assigns sub-tasks to appropriate specialized agents
- **Parallel Execution**: Runs multiple agents concurrently when possible
- **Progress Monitoring**: Tracks completion status of each agent task

### 3. Response Synthesis
- **Result Collection**: Gathers outputs from all participating agents
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles contradictory information from different agents
- **Response Generation**: Creates a unified, coherent response

### 4. Quality Assurance
- **Validation**: Ensures response accuracy and completeness
- **Formatting**: Structures output for optimal user experience
- **Feedback Loop**: Incorporates user feedback for continuous improvement

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical Architecture**: Multi-level agent coordination for complex tasks
- **Specialized Expertise**: Domain-specific agents for different knowledge areas
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent execution for improved performance
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatic agent allocation based on query complexity
- **Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent handling of contradictory information
- **Continuous Learning**: Agent improvement through interaction feedback

## Use Cases
