# SearchQnA - Architecture Implementation Models

## Overview
SearchQnA enhances question-answering applications by integrating web search capabilities with AI-powered response generation. The system combines real-time web search results with intelligent content analysis to provide up-to-date and comprehensive answers.

## Implementation Workflow

### 1. Query Enhancement
- **Query Analysis**: Analyzes user question for search intent
- **Query Enhancement**: Optimizes search terms for better results
- **Search Strategy**: Determines optimal search approach and sources
- **Query Expansion**: Adds relevant keywords and synonyms

### 2. Web Search
- **Multi-Source Search**: Searches across multiple search engines and sources
- **Result Collection**: Gathers search results from various sources
- **Content Extraction**: Extracts relevant content from web pages
- **Metadata Analysis**: Analyzes source credibility and freshness

### 3. Content Analysis
- **Relevance Scoring**: Scores content relevance to the original query
- **Information Extraction**: Extracts key facts and insights
- **Fact Verification**: Cross-references information across sources
- **Bias Detection**: Identifies potential biases in sources

### 4. Response Generation
- **Information Synthesis**: Combines information from multiple sources
- **Response Structuring**: Organizes information into coherent response
- **Source Attribution**: Includes proper source citations
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures response accuracy and completeness
