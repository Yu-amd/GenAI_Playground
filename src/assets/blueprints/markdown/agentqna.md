## Overview

AgentQnA is a sophisticated hierarchical multi-agent system designed for advanced question-answering applications. It leverages multiple specialized agents working in concert to provide comprehensive and accurate responses to complex queries.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Coordinated system of specialized agents
- **Hierarchical Processing**: Structured approach to complex queries
- **Specialized Agents**: Dedicated agents for different aspects of question answering
- **Coordinated Responses**: Seamless integration of multiple agent outputs

## Architecture

The blueprint implements a hierarchical agent system:

1. **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates the overall question-answering process
2. **Specialized Agents**: Handle specific aspects of the query
3. **Response Aggregator**: Combines and refines agent outputs
4. **Quality Control**: Ensures response accuracy and coherence

## Getting Started

To implement this blueprint:

1. Set up the agent infrastructure
2. Configure specialized agents
3. Define agent communication protocols
4. Implement the orchestrator logic

## Configuration

Key configuration parameters:

- Agent specialization settings
- Communication protocols
- Response aggregation rules
- Quality control thresholds

## Best Practices

- Regular agent performance monitoring
- Continuous agent training
- Protocol optimization
- Response quality validation
