## Overview
CodeTrans is a specialized code translation system that converts code between different programming languages while maintaining functionality and best practices. It enables seamless migration and cross-language development.

## Features
- **Multi-Language Translation**: Supports translation between various programming languages
- **Functionality Preservation**: Maintains code behavior during translation
- **Best Practices**: Enforces language-specific coding standards
- **Context Awareness**: Understands project structure and dependencies

## Architecture
The blueprint implements a translation pipeline:
1. **Code Parsing**: Analyzes source code structure
2. **Semantic Analysis**: Understands code functionality
3. **Translation Engine**: Converts code to target language
4. **Optimization**: Refines translated code

## Getting Started
To use this blueprint:
1. Set up the translation environment
2. Configure source and target languages
3. Define translation rules
4. Set up validation framework

## Configuration
Key configuration parameters:
- Language pair settings
- Translation rules
- Optimization preferences
- Validation criteria

## Best Practices
- Regular testing of translations
- Performance optimization
- Code review process
- Documentation updates
