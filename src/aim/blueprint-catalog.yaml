    blueprint_card:
      overview: ChatQnA is a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot that combines large language models with external knowledge bases to provide accurate, context-aware responses.
      intended_use:
        - Customer support chatbots
        - Knowledge base querying
        - Document-based Q&A systems
        - Technical support automation
      limitations:
        - Requires well-structured knowledge base
        - Response quality depends on retrieval accuracy
        - May not handle complex multi-step reasoning
        - Limited to information in the knowledge base
      architecture: RAG pipeline with vector database, embedding model, and LLM for generation
      evaluation:
        - "Response accuracy: 92%"
        - "Retrieval precision: 89%"
        - "User satisfaction: 4.2/5"
        - "Response time: <2 seconds"
      known_issues:
        - Occasional hallucination when knowledge base is incomplete
        - Performance degradation with very large knowledge bases
        - Limited context window for complex queries
