blueprint_card:
  overview: AgentQnA is a multi-agent Q&A system that coordinates multiple specialized agents to answer complex queries.
  intended_use:
    - Complex Q&A
    - Multi-step reasoning
    - Agent-based orchestration
  limitations:
    - Increased system complexity
    - Requires robust agent communication
  architecture: Multi-agent pipeline with orchestrator, specialized agents, and LLM for generation
  evaluation:
    - "Response accuracy: 90%"
    - "Orchestration precision: 87%"
    - "User satisfaction: 4.1/5"
    - "Response time: <3 seconds"
  known_issues:
    - Coordination overhead
    - Potential for agent deadlock
