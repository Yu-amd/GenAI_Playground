blueprint_card:
  overview: DocSum is a specialized documentation summarization workflow that processes technical documentation, API documentation, code comments, and README files to generate structured summaries and extract key technical insights.
  intended_use:
    - Technical documentation summarization
    - API documentation processing
    - Code comment analysis
    - README file summarization
    - Technical writing assistance
  limitations:
    - May miss nuanced technical details
    - Dependent on documentation quality and structure
    - Limited to text-based documentation
  architecture: Documentation processing pipeline with technical content analyzer, key insight extractor, and structured summary generator
  evaluation:
    - "Technical accuracy: 91%"
    - "Key insight extraction: 87%"
    - "User satisfaction: 4.3/5"
    - "Processing time: <3 seconds"
  known_issues:
    - May oversimplify complex technical concepts
    - Performance varies by documentation format
    - Limited support for diagrams and visual content
