blueprint_card:
  overview: CodeTrans is a code translation system that leverages LLMs to convert code between programming languages while preserving functionality.
  intended_use:
    - Code translation
    - Language migration
    - Developer productivity
  limitations:
    - May not support all languages
    - Potential for translation errors
  architecture: Translation pipeline with language detector, code translator, optimizer, and validator
  evaluation:
    - "Translation accuracy: 86%"
    - "Optimization quality: 83%"
    - "User satisfaction: 4.1/5"
    - "Response time: <2 seconds"
  known_issues:
    - Occasional translation bugs
    - Limited support for rare languages
